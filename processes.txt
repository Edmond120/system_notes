Processes
	Every running program is a process. A process can create subproccesses,
	but theses are no different from regualr processes.

	A processor can handle 1 process per cycle (per core).

	"Multitasking" appears to happen because the processor switches
	between all the active processes quickly.

	pid
		Every process has a pid
