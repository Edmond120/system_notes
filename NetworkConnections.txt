Network Connection Types

	Stream Sockets

		Reliable 2 way communication.

		Must be connected on both ends.

		Data received in the order it is sent. (not as easily done as it sounds)

		Most use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

	Datagram Sockets

		"Connectionless" - an established connection is not required.

		Data sent may be recieve out of order (or not at all).

		Use the User Datagram Protocol
