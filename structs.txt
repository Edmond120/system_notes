Struct
	Create a new type that is a collection of values.

	struct {int a; char x; } s;

		Here, s is a variable of type:
			struct { int a; char x; }


	you will have to retype the entire thing to make an new variable of the same type.
	ex:
	struct {int a; char x;} s;
	struct {int a; char x;} s2;
	struct {
		int a;
		char x;
	};
	
	unless you prototype

	ex:
	struct foo { int a; char x;};

		Here, struct foo is a prototype for the kind if struct to be used later:
	
	struct foo s;
	struct foo s2;
	
	you can also declare a struct and prototype it at the same time

	ex:
	struct foo { int a; char x;} s;
	struct foo s2;

	we use the . operator to access a value inside a struct
		s.a = 10;
		s.x - '@';
