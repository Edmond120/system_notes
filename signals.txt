c functions 

	Signal handling in c programs <signal.h>	

	kill(<PID>, <SIGNAL>)
		returns 0 on success or -1 (errno) on failure
	
	sighandler(<SIGNAL>)
		To intercept signals in a c program you must create
		a signal handling function.

		Some signals (like SIGKILL) cannot be cauthg.

		static void sighandler( int signo )

		Must be static, must be void, must take a single int parameter

		static: the function can only be called from within
		 the file it is defined. (where your main is)

	
	How to use:
		static void sighandler( int signo){
			//do stuff
		}
		int main(){
			signal(<SOME SIGNAL>,sighandler);
		}
	
	exit()-
		exits the program.
