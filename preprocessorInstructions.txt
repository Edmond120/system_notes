#
	Used to provide preprocessor instructions

	These directives are handled by gcc first

	#include <LIBRARY> | "LIBRARY"
		link libraries to your code
	
	#define <NAME> <VALUE>
		replace all occurances of Name with Value

		ex. #define TRUE 1
			convention is that the name is written in all caps

	marcos:
		#define SQUARE(x) x * x
				NAME      VALUE
		...
		int y = SQUARE(9); ==> int y = 9 * 9
	
		#define MIN(X, Y) x < y ? x : y

	conditional statement:
		#ifndef <IDENTIFIER>
		<CODE>
		#endif

	If the identifier has been defined, ignore all the code up until the endif statement.
