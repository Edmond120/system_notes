Bitwise Operators
	
	Evaluated on each individual bit of a value.

	>> right shift
		ex. x >> 1

		Move all bits to the right, add 0s in the front

	<<left shift
		ex. x << 1
		
		Move all bits to the left, add 0s in the back

	~ negation
		ex. ~x

		Flip every bit

	| or
		ex: a | b
		
		perform or for each pair of bits in (a,b)

	& and
		ex: a & b
	
		perform and for each pair of bits in (a,b)
	
	^ xor
		ex: a ^ b
		
		perform xor for each pair of bits in (a,b)
