Data Encapsulation

	As data crosses from an upper layer to a lower one, layer-specific metadata is added
	to help aid transmission.

		Application -> transport
			UDP or TCP headers are added, including network port information.

		Transport -> Network
			Data (including Transport headers) is packaged into IP Packets.

		Network -> Link
			Packets (including IP and Transport headers) are packaged into Ethernet
			Frames.

Data decapsulation

	When data crocesses back up a layer, the packaging for the lower layer is removed
