you can combine multiple c files into a c program by including them all in one gcc command. ex 
	gcc test.c string.c foo.c woohoo.c

you cannot have duplicate function or global variable names across these files.

There must be a main function in order to create an executable program.

gcc -c

	will compile a c file into a .o fil, it is not a fully functional program, but it is compiled code.

	Do this to compile a .c file that does not contain a main() function.

.o files can be linked together with each other or .c files through gcc



Make
	Create compiling instructions and setup dependencies.

	standard name for the file is makefile

	syntax:
		<TARGET>; <DEPENDENCIES>
		TAB<RULES>

example of a make file:


----------------------------------------------
strtest: dwstring.o main.o
	gcc -o strtest dwstring.o main.o

dwstring.o: dwstring.c dwstring.h
	gcc -c dwstring.c
----------------------------------------------
