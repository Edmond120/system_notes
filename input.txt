scanf - <stdio.h>

	scanf( <FORMAT STRING>, <VAR 1>, <VAR 2> ...)

	Reads in data from stdin using the format string to determine types.

	Puts the data in each variable.

	Variables must be poitners

	example 
		int x; float f; double d;
		scanf("%d %f %lf",&x,&f,&d);
		
		expected input:1 0.1 0.1
		note that if you put spaces in scanf then it would expect spaces in your input

fgets - <stdio.h>

		Read in from a fiel stream and store it in a string

		fgets( <DESTINATION> , <BYTES>, <FILE POINTER>)

		fgets( s, n, f);
			Reads at most n-1 characters from file stream f and stroes it in s.

		File pointer
	
			FILE * type, more complex than a file descriptor
		
			stdin is a FILE * variable

		Stops at newline, end of file, or the byte limit.

		If applicable, keeps the newline character as part of the string,
		appends NULL after

		fgets(s, 256,stdin)
			read a line of text from standard in

sscanf - <stdio.h>

	Scan a string and extract values based on a format string.

	sscanf(<SOURCE STRING>, <FORMAT STRING>, <VAR 1>, <VAR 2>...)
