umask - <sys/stat.h>
	Set the file creation permission mask

	By default, created files are not given the exact permissions provided in the mode argument to open. Some permissions are automatically shut off.

	Umask is applied the following way:
		
		new_permissions = ~mask & mode
	
	The default mask is 0002.

	umask ( <MASK> );
		you can define the umask using a 3 digit octal #

		umask(0000);

0777 = all permissions
