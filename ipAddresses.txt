IP Addresses

	All devices connected to the internet have an IP address.

	IP addresses come in 2 flavors, IPv4 and IPv6.

	Addresses are allocated in blocks to make routing easier.

		IPv4: 4 byte addresses of the form:

			[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]
				
			Each group is called an octet

			At most there are 2^32, or ~4.3 billion IPv4 addresses
